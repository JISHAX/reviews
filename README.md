This is a clone of the front end of OpenTable's reviews service, in React, Node.js and MySQL.

To start:
  from the 'service' directory `npm i` \n
  then `docker-compose up` from the root directory \n
  navigate to localhost:3005 to see mock reviews for one restaurant \n

the db has mock data for 100 restaurants; reviews are viewable by going to localhost:3005/restaurants/<n between 1 and 100>/
